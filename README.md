# Jellyfin XML playlist randomizer

Randomize the Jellyfin's XML playlist entries. This way you can "shuffle" the playlist without needing to worry about seeing the same item multiple times.
This application was quickly made in a couple of minutes and was only tested for video playlists on Jellyfin 10.7.7, so be aware of bugs or crashes.
